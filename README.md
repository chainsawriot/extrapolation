we have created a prediction model of PolPolI using the CBIdiff according to the community structure and 21-day-lagged regression model derived from the data between July 2014 and June 2015. This model is deployed to forecast the PolPolIYouth between July 1, 2015, and August 31, 2015. Based on the results, our simple model can predict the trend of future PolPolI using the CBIdiff with R2 equals to 0.3, indicating the validity of the model prediction.
